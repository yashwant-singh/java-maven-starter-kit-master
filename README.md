# Pre-requisites
* Java 1.8/1.11/1.15
* Maven

# How to run the code

We have provided scripts to execute the code. 

Use `run.sh` if you are Linux/Unix/macOS Operating systems and `run.bat` if you are on Windows.

Internally both the scripts run the following commands 

 * `mvn clean install -DskipTests assembly:single -q` - This will create a jar file `geektrust.jar` in the `target` folder.
 * `java -jar target/geektrust.jar sample_input/input1.txt` - This will execute the jar file passing in the sample input file as the command line argument

 Use the pom.xml provided along with this project. Please change the main class entry (<mainClass>com.example.geektrust.Main</mainClass>) in the pom.xml if your main class has changed.

 # How to execute the unit tests

 `mvn clean test` will execute the unit test cases.

   All Geektrust challenges are meant to be solved offline. Once you have completed the challenge, you can test and submit your code here. Your score will be determined based on factors such as OOPS, readability, and scalability.

   You should read what we look for in your solution before you start coding. It is NOT about just getting the right output.

   The challenge

   You work at a fintech startup that helps housemates calculate and manage their expenses. Your task is to build this expense calculator. 

   The housemates stay in a 3 bedroom house where a maximum of 3 people can stay. The expenses calculator can be used only when there are at least 2 people in the house. Once there are at least 2 people in the house, then the expenses are tracked in the software you build. Once their expenses are tracked, a member of the house can only move out of the house if they have cleared the dues.
                        


   Input Commands

   MOVE_IN <name-of-the-member>

   This command allows a member to be moved into the house. It outputs SUCCESS if the addition is successful. If the house is already full with the maximum number of members, then it should print an error message HOUSEFUL.
                            
  Example- 

  MOVE_IN ANDY
  MOVE_IN WOODY
  MOVE_IN BO
  MOVE_IN REX

  Output
  SUCCESS
  SUCCESS
  SUCCESS
  HOUSEFUL

  SPEND  <amount> <spent-by> <spent-for-member1> <spent-for-member2>

  This command adds the total expenditure made by a person for all the persons in the command including themself. Amount is the the total amount spent.  Spent-by indicates who spent it, and spent-for-member1 indicates who all needs to share the expense. There can be multiple spent-for in a SPEND command. 

  The SPEND command splits the expenditure amongst all the members and calculates the dues for each person. It should print SUCCESS if the calculation is completed successfully. If the members are not yet added then an error message MEMBER_NOT_FOUND  should be printed. All the expenditure add up and can cancel out each other.

  Example-

  SPEND 3000 ANDY WOODY BO
  SPEND 300 WOODY BO
  SPEND 300 WOODY REX

  Output
  SUCCESS
  SUCCESS
  MEMBER_NOT_FOUND

  In the above example after the first command, WOODY owes 1000 to ANDY and BO owes 1000 to ANDY. After the next command, BO owes 150 to WOODY. This 150 gets adjusted in the dues so that WOODY now owes 850 to ANDY and BO owes 1150 to ANDY and 0 to WOODY.

  DUES <member-who-owes>

  This command prints all the dues of a member against all the other members in the format - <member-who-lent> <amount> Dues against all the members should be printed and each member should be printed in one line in the descending order of the pending amount. If the amount due is same, then those should be sorted on the ascending order of the member's name. 

  If the member is not yet added then an error message MEMBER_NOT_FOUND should be printed.

  Example- 

  DUES BO
  DUES WOODY

  Output
  ANDY 1150
  WOODY 0
  ANDY 850
  BO 0

  CLEAR_DUE  <member-who-owes> <member-who-lent> <amount>

  Any member can clear the due of the other member who lent using this command. The amount can be partial or full. It cannot be more than the amount owed as per the DUES command. If they pay more, then an error message INCORRECT_PAYMENT should be printed and none of the payments should go through.	

  This command should print the remaining dues of the member against whom they paid.

  Example-

    CLEAR_DUE BO ANDY 500 
    CLEAR_DUE BO ANDY 2500 

    Output
    650
    INCORRECT_PAYMENT

    MOVE_OUT <name-of-existing-member>

    This command should print SUCCESS if the member has cleared all the dues with all the members of the house and no other members are owing any dues to the member. 

    If the member has some dues to be paid or received then an error message FAILURE should be printed.

    If the member is not part of the house then an error message MEMBER_NOT_FOUND  should be printed.

    Example-

    MOVE_OUT ANDY
    MOVE_OUT WOODY
    MOVE_OUT BO
    CLEAR_DUE BO ANDY 650
    MOVE_OUT BO
    MOVE_OUT REX

    Output
    FAILURE
    FAILURE
    FAILURE
    0
    SUCCESS
    MEMBER_NOT_FOUND
                        

ðŸš©Important Notes

   1. Maximum number of members in a house is 3.

   2. A member can move out of the house only if he/she has paid their dues to all other members.

   3. Expenses can be added only if there are at least 2 members in the house.

   4. 3rd member can be added any time and they share the expenses incurred after they move in. 

   5. A member can move out only if they have paid all the dues and no other members are owing any money to them.

   6. All calculations should be rounded off to the nearest integer. No decimal values are used. 

   7. A member can only pay less than or equal to the amount they owe the other members. If they pay more, then an error should be shown and none of the payments go through.

   8. For the DUES command, dues against all the members should be printed and each member should be printed in one line in the descending order of the pending amount. If the amount due is same, then those should be sorted on the ascending order of the member's name. 

   9. This problem doesn't require use of databases. All the calculations are to be handled in memory.
